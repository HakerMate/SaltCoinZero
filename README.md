SaltCoinZero

Invented by HackerMate (Arnold Mosqueda)

SaltCoinZero is an autonomous, offline cryptographic minting protocol that leverages radiospace chemistry, matrix entropy, and quantum-variance hashing to generate unforgeable digital assets and sovereign identity wallets.

Overview

SaltCoinZero does not rely on traditional blockchain consensus. Instead, it introduces:
	•	A quantum-modulated entropy matrix inspired by radiochemical decay and electromagnetic drift
	•	EVO-Hashed Wallets using SHA-256 + Blake2b salted via quantum noise
	•	Autonomous coin minting fully independent of any online network
	•	A protocol heartbeat calibrated to Earth’s EM frequency (approx. 50.5Hz)

This enables localized, sovereign value generation based solely on physics-informed entropy.
